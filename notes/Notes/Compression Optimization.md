The recommended minimum object size for gzip compression to provide performance benefits typically depends on several factors, including the nature of the content, network conditions, and the capabilities of the server and client involved. However, as a general guideline, a commonly suggested threshold for considering gzip compression is around 1500-2000 bytes.

Gzip compression works by identifying and compressing repetitive or redundant patterns within the data. Smaller objects or data chunks might not contain enough redundancy to make compression worthwhile, resulting in minimal compression gains or even potentially increasing the overall data size due to compression overhead.

Therefore, it's generally more effective to apply gzip compression to larger objects or files. This allows for better compression ratios and a higher likelihood of finding repetitive patterns within the data.

However, it's important to consider the trade-off between compression gains and the additional computational overhead required for compression and decompression. Smaller objects might still benefit from gzip compression if the network bandwidth is limited or if the server and client have sufficient processing capabilities to handle the compression/decompression overhead.

In practice, it's recommended to perform benchmarking and testing with your specific content and environment to determine the optimal object size for gzip compression. Monitor the compression ratios, network latency, and the impact on server and client performance to find the right balance.

Additionally, keep in mind that modern web servers and browsers often negotiate compression automatically, considering factors like the content type and client support. Therefore, it's a good practice to enable gzip compression at the server level and let the negotiation between the server and client determine when compression is beneficial.

Ultimately, the optimal minimum object size for gzip compression depends on your specific use case and the characteristics of the content and network involved.

## Akamai's Compression Size Recommendation

The minimum size Akamai will compress the requested object when sending it to the end user: The minimum size is 860 bytes.

The reasons 860 bytes is the minimum size for compression is twofold: (1) The overhead of compressing an object under 860 bytes outweighs performance gain. (2) Objects under 860 bytes can be transmitted via a single packet anyway, so there isn't a compelling reason to compress them.
