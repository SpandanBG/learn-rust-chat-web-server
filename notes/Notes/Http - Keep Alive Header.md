| Http Version | Description |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP/1.0 | In HTTP/1.0, connections are not considered persistent unless the client sends a Connection: keep-alive header with the request. When the server accepts a persistent connection request, it sends a Connection: keep-alive header back to the client in response. After that, the connection remains open, and the client sends other requests using the same connection. The connection will remain open until the client or server drops the connection. |
| HTTP/1.1 | In HTTP/1.1, all connections are considered persistent unless otherwise specified and do not require additional Connection: keep-alive headers to establish a persistent connection. For example, the default connection timeout for Apache httpd 1.3 and 2.0 is 15 seconds and only 5 seconds for Apache httpd 2.2 and above. The advantage of a short timeout is to quickly deliver multiple web page components without using resources for too long running multiple server processes or threads. |
| HTTP/2 | Connection and Keep-Alive headers are not allowed in HTTP/2. Chrome and Firefox ignore these headers in HTTP/2 responses, but Safari will not load the web page if the server returns these headers in error. |
